Hi! I'm software engineer and researcher at quasardb.

### More Information

As my current occupation, I work on a smart, extremely performant data storage software (which can be limited to a NoSQL database) called *quasardb*.

I'm passionate about software development, C++ programming language and algorithmics in general, as well as linguistics and foreign languages.
In my free time (when I have no other obligations), I like doing genealogical research, solving algorithmic problems, hacking Arduino and doing crafts.

Before I worked on autonomous vehicles where I was enhancing the car's perception system by injecting cartographical map information (I did what is often elegantly called *data fusion*).

Apart from my C.S. backround, I've studied applied linguistics that has been my passion since (at least) my adulthood.
And, incidentally, I speak 6 languages, but I'd love to go up to 10 or more, time permitting.
